# Project analysis

Here contains some data analyzing project, meant to show basic data analyzing skills, data manipulation, visualization and logical thinking.



## Project - Online magazine analysis.

project-Online-magazine-analysis is about lite analysis on an online magazine. 
A young startup recently launched an innovative online magazine and is investing heavily in online marketing in order to grow its subscriber base. As a part of their growth effort they need to better understand their user base , i have a sample of 50,000 of their users and want to answer basic exploratory questions on this dataset. 
The company is currently investing heavily in online marketing channels in order to acquire subscribers. The marketing channels are Criteo, Facebook, Instagram, Adwords and some select Partners (grouped under the “Partner” category). Additionally, they offer a referral programme for their existing subscribers to invite their friends. The core of their business model is offering interesting content so users acquire and retain a paid subscription. 
At the moment, subscriptions can be 1 Month, 3 Month, 6 Month and 12 Month long. In addition: 

```
marketing_budget_split = {'Criteo':185000,'TV':30000,'Facebook':550000,'Adwords':40000,'Instagram':700000,'Partner':'25% Share of first subscription price with minimum of 5 euros'} prices = {'1M':12.99,'3M':32.99,'6M':53.99,'12M':83.99} 
```

### Questions: 
Every question is an open ended question and phrased in a non precise way on purpose. Part of the challenge is to answer ambiguous tasks with analytical answers. There exist multiple ways of answering the same question. 

1. Who are our customers? (gender, age, where from?) 
2. Where and what are we selling the most? (locations, products) 
3. Can you identify some reading patterns? (times a day, days a week, how many times a user goes back to an article, most liked/read 
4. What is the correlation between article reading length - liked - times read? 
5. Summarise your findings aimed at the startup where you will tell them what you found and what would be your recommendations .  
6. Bonus - Which marketing channels are performing well?

## Project - Handwash effect for COVID19. 

The effect of washing your hands as a remedy against spreading bacteria and can be effective for COVID19. 

Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about childbed fever: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. 

He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and wash their hands! 

In this notebook, i am going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Let's begin exploring how Dr. Semmelweis came to his conclusions!

## Project - Stock Market Analysis.

Welcome to my Stock Market Analysis project! In this portfolio project i will be looking at data from the stock market, particularly 4 healthcare stocks namely Pfizer Inc,Novartis AG,GlaxoSmithKline plc and Johnson & Johnson. 

I will use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally i will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history.

I will be answering the following questions along the way:

1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?

2. What was the daily return of the stock on average?

3. What was the moving average of the various stocks?

4. What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?

5. What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?

6. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?



## Project - Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction
Predict how much GStore customers will spend.

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businesses–only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

In this competition, I am challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. 

Using Random forest regressor , i attempted to make this prediction.
